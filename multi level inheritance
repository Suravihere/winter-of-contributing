Multi Level Inheritance in cpp.
In case of multi level inheritance there is a derived class which inherits from another derived class.
Here is an example code on this topic.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class C{
public:
void show(){
cout<<"Hey! I am Base class 2:<<endl;
}
};
class B:public C{
public:
void show1(){
cout<<"Hey! I am Base Class 1";
}
};
class A:public B{
public:
void show2(){
public:
void show2(){
cout<<"Hey! I am Derived Class"<<endl;
}
};
int main(){
A obj;
obj.show():
obj.show1():
obj.show2();
return 0;
}
